This project investigates how median household income and property data correlate with access to parks and green spaces in Baltimore City. Utilizing Landsat-8 satellite imagery and census data, the study spans from 2015 to 2020, providing a comprehensive view of urban green space accessibility. Key findings indicate that areas with higher property values and household incomes have better access to manicured parks, while lower-income areas tend to have more forest-like green spaces. The research highlights the need for equitable urban planning to ensure all residents can enjoy the benefits of green spaces.
